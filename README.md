# JuliaReach & JuliaIntervals Days 3: Reachathon

## What?

In the spirit of a [Hackathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon), our Reachathon is allocated to discuss and implement exploratory solutions to programming tasks related to the workshop.

Every contribution and initiative counts, from first-time contributors seeking guidance in ways to contribute to JuliaReach and JuliaIntervals packages, to developments of more advanced research topics or tools proposed in the Challenge problems session the first day of the workshop.
